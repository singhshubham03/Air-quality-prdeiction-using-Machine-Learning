# Air Quality Prediction using Machine Learning

This project aims to predict the air quality of a given location using machine learning algorithms. The dataset used in this project is obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The dataset contains hourly readings from various sensors for five years.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

## Approach

1. **Data Preparation:** Load the data from the CSV file, handle missing values, and filter out irrelevant columns.
2. **Data Exploration:** Explore the dataset to gain insights into the data distribution and correlations.
3. **Feature Engineering:** Create new features by combining existing features to enhance the predictive power of the model.
4. **Model Selection:** Choose the most suitable machine learning algorithm for the problem and evaluate its performance using cross-validation.
5. **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Fine-tune the hyperparameters of the selected algorithm to improve its performance.
6. **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate the performance of the final model on the test dataset and visualize the results.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the use of machine learning algorithms to predict air quality. The results show that machine learning models can accurately predict air quality based on historical sensor readings. The project also highlights the importance of data preparation and feature engineering in improving the predictive power of the model. The final model achieved an accuracy of 85%, which is a significant improvement over the baseline accuracy of 70%.
